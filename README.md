# How to use?
SyncMalloc is thoroughly evaluated through diverse performance tests detailed in the directory *./Experiments* or *.src/MMUOnCPUPingPongFinalVersion*. These evaluations include the **Singular Mixed-size Test**, **Scaling Test**, **Random Allocation Test**, and **detailed Breakdowns of the system**.

## Singular Mixed-size Test and Scaling Test
To demonstrate the performance of both the Singular Mixed-size Test and the Scaling Test, please refer to the *./Experiments/singleAllocation/MMUOnCPUPingPongFinalVersion/singleAllocation.cu* example file. This file utilizes the *HMCoAllocate* function to dynamically allocate memory per thread. The size of the memory allocation can be specified within each thread. The number of threads can be configured using *BLOCKNUMBER* and *BLOCKSIZE* in the *MMUOnCPU.hpp* file.

To complie:
`nvcc -rdc=true singleAllocation.cu MMUOnCPU.cu -lpthread`

## Random Allocation Test
The Random Allocation Test evaluates the efficiency of SyncMalloc under rigorous conditions using the files *./Experiments/randomAllocation/randomAllocationLarge.cu* for large allocations and  *testshbenchOnFirstClass.cu* for smaller allocations. These tests involve multiple threads performing a series of random-sized memory operations including allocations and deallocations. Each thread runs for *n* times, specified by *ALL_FREE_TIMES* in the code, and can vary from 0.5K to 10K iterations. The operations, whether allocations or deallocations, are randomly generated, stored in the *d_isAllocate* and *d_freeBlock* arrays, and executed by the GPU based on these instructions.

To complie:
`nvcc -rdc=true randomAllocationLarge.cu MMUOnCPU.cu -lpthread`

or 

`nvcc -rdc=true testshbenchOnFirstClass.cu MMUOnCPU.cu -lpthread`

Note: For tests involving small allocations, set *BLOCKSIZE* to 16, because the benchmark of the Random Allocation Test is designed to initialize a small array to store the unique scope. But, the *BLOCKNUMBER* can be adjusted as needed to accommodate the unique scope of the Random Allocation Test.

## Detailed Breakdowns of the system
The detailed performance breakdowns are conducted using directories *./Experiments/selfEvalutation/MMUOnCPUPingPongV1.3.6BrekDownsGPU* and *./Experiments/selfEvalutation/MMUOnCPUPingPongV1.3.6BrekDownsHosts*. These tests analyze the overhead by inserting time measurement functions in the function, *blockAllocationThr*, where each thread deals with block allocations on the host. This setup provides insight into the efficiency and scalability of system operations across both GPU and Host environments.
